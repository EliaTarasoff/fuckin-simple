# Fuckin' Simple!
This is a game-system I made up, that's like Fate, but generalized.
It combines and simplifies skills / approaches / stunts (numbers / mechanics stuff),
and adds mechanics that the base system leaves out (attributes like strength, intelligence, equipment and tools)
which other game systems have, using the guidelines from the Fate System Toolkit.
