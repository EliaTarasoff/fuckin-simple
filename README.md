# Fuckin' Simple!
This is a game-system I made up, that's like Fate, but generalized.
It combines and simplifies skills / approaches / stunts (numbers / mechanics stuff),
and adds mechanics that the base system leaves out (attributes like strength, intelligence, equipment and tools)
which other game systems have, using the guidelines from the Fate System Toolkit.

# It's All In The Numbers!
Skills, approaches, stunts, etc, have all been combined.
They're all effectively just numeric bonuses to add to the dice-rolls,
so I felt that having completely disparate rules for them all was too cumbersome,
and too limiting.

So now, you can make your character as broad or specialized as you want.
Hopefully this is balanced for small groups of people, but if not, Fate is meant
for cooperative play anyways, so rulings can be made individually.

The way it works, is that specialized things are cheap, and broad things are expensive.
A character who only wants to have the skills Lockpicking, Derringers, and Traps might get them
all for one point per +1 bonus / level.
They also take a stunt "Pistol Whipper: +2 attack with pistols in melee" for one point.
Then they dump the rest of their points into extra stress-boxes, and they're a durable thief!
Their friend, also playing in a game of espionage and sneakery, will have similar skills.
However, since they want to take out enemies rather than avoiding them,
might allocate their skills differently.
They pick handguns (more broad than derringers) for 3 points per level,
karate-chop for one point per level (specific to non-lethal melee damage),
and throwing-stars for one point per level (similarly specific).
They take a more broad stunt than their sneaky friend,
"Hat Combat: +2 attack with hats (melee or ranged)" for three points.
Then, they dump the rest of their points into sneakery at nine points per level,
which covers camouflage, disguises, quiet-walking, grappling hooks - everything else for being a spy!

How expensive is everything, and how many points do players get?
I made a table / spreadsheet, to have the cheapest things one point per level,
small groups of related skills or less-narrow stunts at three points,
and even broader groups at nine points and twenty seven points.
I also gave some examples of what might be "typical" skills / stunts / approaches,
based on what's in the main Fate rules or SRD guides.
However, you might want to play the game more broadly or narrowly - just slide the columns
left or right, to suit your playstyle!
As for starting skills, based on Fate Core and Fate Accelerated, it looks like 
players should start with about 10-20 points to spend.
More gritty games would have lower starting economies, and more adventurous
games would have higher starting economies, as well as more broadly-defined skills or
groups of skills.
